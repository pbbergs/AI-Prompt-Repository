Important points in an AI Prompt
    Thx to Jeff Su - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4v5AS4RIM&t=40s 
 
Task - Always start with an action verb 
      . Generate, Give, Write, etc...
      . Articulate the end goal   
      . Give a list of any exclusions
Context - Limit the possible answers (Don't give it the ability for an infinite number of responses). Force it to focus on what you specifically want/need.
      . What is the user's "Background"?
      . What does "Success" look like?
      . What "Environment" are they in?
            . I am a 7 handicap golfer <Background>
            . Looking to improve my short game over the summer <Success>
            . I only have time to go to the driving range twice a week <Environment>
            . What drills can I do to help me become a more accurate chipper around the green <outcome>
Example(s) -  Follow the details below to help you formulate an answer
      . Including example(s) drastically improves the output of what was expected
Persona - Who do you want AI to act like?   
      . Industry Expert, Written like a 7th grader, Sound like Captain Kirk talking to Spock, etc...   
Format - Visualize the exact format you would like to see the end result have   (Giving an example from output you have created or a previous response helps)
      . Output in table format with column headers: Product, Cost and Net  (This should be able to be copied to Excel)         
      . Output in h2 format   
      . Output in Outlook format   
      . Output in PowerShell format  
      . Output in bullet points (numbered) format   
      . Output in tree format
Tone - How the reply should be written  
      . Use a formal tone, show enthusiasm, sound optimistic   
            . Please give me a complete list of all "Tone" words that I could use in my prompt   
            . Give me a list of 5 tone keywords that I could include to prevent me from sounding arogent
